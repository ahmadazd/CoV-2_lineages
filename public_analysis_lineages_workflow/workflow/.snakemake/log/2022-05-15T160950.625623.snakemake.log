Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 1 of /hps/software/users/cochrane/ena/azyoud/lineages/lineages_workflow/workflow/rules/create_multifasta.smk:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds:
/hps/nobackup/cochrane/ena/users/azyoud/lineages_workflow_output/private_multifasta/end.txt
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Job id: 3 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 3
Shutting down, this might take some time.
